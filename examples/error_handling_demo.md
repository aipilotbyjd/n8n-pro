## Key Improvements

### 1. Specific Error Codes
- Each error type has a unique code (e.g., `email_exists`, `password_too_weak`)
- Allows frontend applications to handle different error types programmatically
- Enables better error tracking and analytics

### 2. User-Friendly Messages
- Clear, non-technical language that users can understand
- Specific guidance on what went wrong
- No jargon or developer-specific terms

### 3. Actionable Details
- Provides clear next steps for users
- Explains how to resolve the issue
- Includes helpful context when appropriate

### 4. Security Considerations
- Uses generic "Invalid email address or password" to prevent user enumeration
- Doesn't reveal whether an email exists in the system
- Rate limiting errors provide clear guidance without exposing system details

### 5. Context Information
- Includes relevant data that can help with debugging (for developers)
- Provides structured information for frontend applications
- Maintains user privacy while being helpful

### 6. Progressive Enhancement
- Password validation provides specific requirements that are missing
- Email validation explains the correct format
- Gradual feedback helps users create valid accounts

## Implementation Features

### Password Validation
- Minimum length requirements
- Character type requirements (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters)
- Common password detection
- Detailed feedback on missing requirements

### Email Validation
- Format validation with clear error messages
- Detection of common email issues (consecutive dots, invalid domain format)
- User-friendly guidance on proper email format

### Account State Management
- Different messages for different account states (disabled, suspended, pending verification)
- Clear guidance on how to resolve account issues
- Security-conscious handling of sensitive states

### Error Response Structure
- Consistent error format across all endpoints
- Machine-readable error codes
- Human-readable messages and details
- Optional context for additional information
- Timestamp and request tracking capabilities
